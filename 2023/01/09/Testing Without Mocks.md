> The patterns combine [sociable](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#sociable-tests), [state-based](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#state-based-tests) tests with a novel infrastructure technique called “[Nullables](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#nullables).” At first glance, Nullables look like test doubles, but they're actually production code with an “off” switch. And that’s the tradeoff: do you want that in your production code? Your answer determines whether this pattern language is for you.

Very interesting approach to doing testing without using mocks. This is a very long read. However, it's well structured and can be done in takes.
