The key to any successful startup is close collaboration between product and engineering. This sounds easy, but can be incredibly difficult. Both groups may have conflicting goals and different definitions of success that have to be reconciled.\nAccording to the author, the bottleneck can be fixed by identifying the “First Team.”\nThe First Team mindset was defined by Patrick Lencioni and referenced in many of his works including The Advantage and The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team: A Leadership Fable, and while it’s typically used in relation with the establishment of cross-functional leadership teams as the primary accountability team rather than organizational reports, the same concept is applicable here for product teams.",

Advanced computer languages were invented to simulate complex systems such as oil refineries and semi-intelligent behavior. The soon-to-follow paradigm shift of modern personal computing, overlapping window interfaces, and object-oriented design came from seeing the work of the sixties as something more than a “better old thing.",

It was a sort of social network dedicated to sharing technical knowledge. There’s where gems like “Syndicating Content” could be found.\nPeople want content and want to consume it at their own pace. They don’t want to have to click twice to get to that news piece you just edited last night and took an entire morning to publish.\n",

But how is that a weakness? Everyone knows SQL. All major database engines support SQL. SQL is expressive enough to solve any data-related task. SQL has a solid standards committee that maintains and improves it. What can your language offer besides being created in the 2020s?",

In many situations, producers fear making changes to APIs once they realize they have consumers. Producers stop iterating on their API design, missing the opportunity to publish improvements.\n",
