Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse effectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs.\n",

The horn is aimed at a sound and with the push of a button it’s converted into an image. Images are therefore framed with ears instead of eyes since the camera can hear but cannot see. The resulting ‘photo’ is indexical of the surrounding soundscape and not of the scene in front of the camera.\n",

The camera operates by collecting data from its location using open APIs. Utilising the address, weather, time of day, and nearby places, Paragraphica creates a paragraph that details a representation of the current place and moment. Using a text-to-image API, the camera converts the paragraph into a unique visualization. The resulting “photo” is not just a snapshot, but a complex and nuanced reflection of the location you are at.\n",

TaxiQL is part of the Taxi Spec - it’s a query language that lets consumers ask for data they want using the same semantic types that producers have embedded in their API specs.\nIt’s interesting to see another query language popping up. The company behind it, Orbital, evaluated several alternatives and didn’t find anything that would be a good fit. They mention that with Taxi, software can orchestrate automation between APIs automagically.\n",

We’re going to need a standard for proving that a piece of media comes from a real camera. We’re going to need a trustable way to tell if an image has been generated or modified, and by which software. This can be achieved using cryptographic signatures. Each hardware and software that creates or modifies a piece of media can sign it with a private key, leaving a digital trace behind. There is ongoing work in that field, a promising one being the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).\n",

The most pragmatic position is to think of A.I. as a tool, not a creature. My attitude doesn’t eliminate the possibility of peril: however we think about it, we can still design and operate our new tech badly, in ways that can hurt us or even lead to our extinction. Mythologizing the technology only makes it more likely that we’ll fail to operate it well—and this kind of thinking limits our imaginations, tying them to yesterday’s dreams. We can work better under the assumption that there is no such thing as A.I. The sooner we understand this, the sooner we’ll start managing our new technology intelligently.\n",

The patterns combine sociable, state-based tests with a novel infrastructure technique called “Nullables.” At first glance, Nullables look like test doubles, but they’re actually production code with an “off” switch. And that’s the tradeoff: do you want that in your production code? Your answer determines whether this pattern language is for you.\nVery interesting approach to doing testing without using mocks. This is a very long read. However, it’s well structured and can be done in takes.\n",

The question becomes even more complex due to the nature of an API (which we will discuss shortly) – that being said, we can at least start with some of the earliest conceptual formations towards the idea of an API with the work of Wilkes, Wheeler, and Gill.\n",

But they started using their methods to study economics – a field now dubbed econophysics. Instead of looking at how two balls interact, they looked at how two people might interact in a transaction, and then modeled how that might play out on a large scale. This helped them model wealth distribution.\n",

The key to any successful startup is close collaboration between product and engineering. This sounds easy, but can be incredibly difficult. Both groups may have conflicting goals and different definitions of success that have to be reconciled.\nAccording to the author, the bottleneck can be fixed by identifying the “First Team.”\nThe First Team mindset was defined by Patrick Lencioni and referenced in many of his works including The Advantage and The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team: A Leadership Fable, and while it’s typically used in relation with the establishment of cross-functional leadership teams as the primary accountability team rather than organizational reports, the same concept is applicable here for product teams.\n",

What tool would you use? Why would it be useful?\nI wasn’t expecting much. However, I received a bunch of replies. Most people focused on answering what they’re using for API Design, and not necessarily for doing low-fidelity mockups. Here’s a list of ideas that people shared:\nDarrel Mirrel shares that he uses Mermaid graph diagrams to design and describe resource URLs. Erik Wilde writes that he starts with something he calls “API stories.” Those stories inform Erik of the experience that users have while interacting with the API. After figuring out what those stories are, Erik defines how the API will work. Heimo Laukkanen explains that he starts by drafting endpoint URLs and descriptions using a Markdown document. He then uses Stoplight mocking to make sense of the API experience before writing any code. Luca Ferrari shares that he starts with simple user stories to identify possible endpoints, objects, and interactions. Oscar Islas says (in Spanish) that he creates an API mock that always returns a static example. To do that, Oscar uses Postman. However, Oscar recommends using SoapUI for things that are custom and flexible. It’s interesting to see the diversity in approaches to API Design.\n",

Designing without real data leads to a whole host of problems # We look at the problem through a narrow lens\nWe end up focusing on the optimal state, or perfecting pixels, instead of considering all the contexts and use cases someone could experience.\n‍ **This increases bias in our work\n**If we take a best guess to fill in the gaps of data ourselves, it’s not representative and relies on our own mental models. So we’re likely to miss things that are meaningful or important to users.\n‍ **Because of that, we make worse decisions\n**We can’t fully consider edge cases, errors and all the problems users might face without seeing real data and content in our designs.\n‍ **It takes us longer to get to the impact we want\n**When we test static designs, the quality and accuracy of feedback lacks detail. So we delay asking the right questions or spotting things that data would show us instantly. ‍ **The result? There’s a gap between the designs we make and the product our users interact with\n**This seems almost inevitable given that most tools over index on solving visual problems right now. Kernel looks like a very interesting tool—at least in concept—that can connect an API to a Figma component to populate it. Unfortunately, at this time, it only works with static JSON documents and with Google Sheets.\n",

Especially for web-applications, it’s sensible to split the frontend (data-presentation, user-I/O) from the “real” application. This cleanly separates the presentation from the logic, and (additionally to the advantages above) simplifies the creation/use of alternative frontends and last but not least improves security because the frontend (usually running with webserver-rights) doesn’t have direct access to the data, but may only call some functions of an other process.\n",

API-First: This is an increasingly promoted approach. Basically, it means that your organization treats APIs as the core focus with the understanding that they are critical business assets upon which the organization operates. This process is initiated with a contract written in an API description language such as OpenAPI. There’s nothing wrong with this way, and it’s wise to standardize early across a platform or set of products. The problem is that the chosen language and its particulars often dominate and even limit a company’s ability to scale and build for the future. If your API is the most important thing, what does that say about all the people developing it and/or consuming it?\n",

Advanced computer languages were invented to simulate complex systems such as oil refineries and semi-intelligent behavior. The soon-to-follow paradigm shift of modern personal computing, overlapping window interfaces, and object-oriented design came from seeing the work of the sixties as something more than a “better old thing.”\n",

Exchanging quality of service for investment bandwidth is a key tradeoff within an infrastructure organization, but it’s hardly the only one. Operating an infrastructure organization is maintaining a dynamic balance across many forces. You need to balance tech debt against morale. You need to balance iterating on the usability of your capabilities against delivering them before being crushed by an exponentially scaling problem tomorrow. You also need to balance your budget.\n",

Is there a parameter for that? Can the API do X? Learning requires effort, but the more the developer learns, the more problems they can solve. We can imagine the developers climbing a ladder where, for every step they take up the “learning ladder”3, the more problems they can solve.\n",

I say vague because I’m not going to make grand claims to the techniques that I discuss in this book. It is enough to say that I have found them useful over the last decade whether in finding opportunity, removing waste, helping to organise a team of people or determining the strategy for a company. Will they help you? That depends upon the context that you’re operating in but since the techniques don’t take long to learn then I’ll leave it up to the reader to discover whether they are helpful to them or not. Remember, all models are wrong but some are useful.\n",

The World After Capital has two goals. The first is to establish that we are currently experiencing a third period of globally transformative, non-linear change. The key argument is that each time, the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, the defining constraint for humanity shifts—meaning the allocation problem that most fundamentally needs to be solved in order to meet humanity’s needs changes. Specifically, the invention of agriculture shifted scarcity from food to land, and industrialization shifted scarcity from land to capital (which throughout The World After Capital refers to physical capital, such as machines and buildings, unless otherwise noted). Digital technology is now shifting scarcity from capital to attention.\n",

REST APIs often include dependency constraints that restrict how two or more parameters can be combined to form valid API calls. These inter-parameter dependencies make it difficult to automatically interact with the services, since API specification languages offer little or no support for them. We carried out a study on 40 industrial APIs and found that 85% of them contain inter-parameter dependencies. More importantly, we classified all the dependencies found (over 600) into seven patterns, serving as the basis for future proposals for modeling and analyzing inter-parameter dependencies automatically.\n",

When using asynchronous communication… | by Mertcan Arguç | Dec, 2021 | Dev Genius” on 2022-01-26 12:16:39. When using asynchronous communication for Microservices, it is common to use a message broker. A broker ensures communication between different microservices is reliable and stable, that the messages are managed and monitored within the system and that messages don’t get lost. There are a few message brokers you can choose from, varying in scale and data capabilities. This blog post will compare the three most popular brokers: RabbitMQ, Kafka and Redis.\n",

Gemini is a new application-level internet protocol for the distribution of arbitrary files, with some special consideration for serving a lightweight hypertext format which facilitates linking between files. You may think of Gemini as “the web, stripped right back to its essence” or as “Gopher, souped up and modernised just a little”, depending upon your perspective (the latter view is probably more accurate).\n",

Some people use the term “Web 3.0” to refer only to decentralized blockchain-based networks without considering that all personal websites have essentially the same goals, be they on the regular Internet or on the new blockchain networks. Those who use the term “web 3.0” seem to have forgotten that self-hosted personal websites that run on home servers and are accessible over the regular Internet are inherently decentralized. Unfortunately, despite common goals, some on today’s old Internet are hostile to blockchain technology. I am not sure why. Perhaps this is because we seem to be hard-wired to focus on the new and ignore the old, and owners of personal websites on the regular Internet feel ignored. Perhaps they feel the presence of the new blockchain technology only helps to obscure the fact that personal websites on the regular Internet are likely to become a larger more important part of the Internet of the Future–regardless of whether we call it the “old Internet”, “Web 3.0”, or something else. Perhaps someone should come up with a more descriptive name. Maybe a name like “The Cyberfreedom Network” would attract more attention.\n",
