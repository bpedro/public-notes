I finally see a concrete focus on improving the way entrepreneurs work in the European Union. Having a single set of rules for the company lifecycle throughout Europe has been needed for a long time.

> The ultimate aim is to create a new, truly European company structure. **We call it EU Inc.**, with a single and simple set of rules that will apply seamlessly all over our Union. So that business can operate across Member States much more easily. Our entrepreneurs, the innovative companies, will be able to register a company in any Member State within 48 hours – fully online. They will enjoy the same capital regime all across the EU. Ultimately, we need a system where companies can do business and raise financing seamlessly across Europe – just as easily as in uniform markets like the US or China. If we get this right – and if we move fast enough – this will not only help EU companies grow. But it will attract investment from across the world.—Ursula von der Leyen, World Economic Forum 2026
