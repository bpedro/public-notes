summary: Influencers lack consistency
---
Something I've been noticing more and more is the way many so-called "tech opinion-makers" keep changing their position on social media. They lack consistency. They keep complaining about life difficulties. They focus their communication on themselves and not on the needs of their audiences. Why this happens is something I can't understand. However, it seems to attract followers; otherwise, those "influencers" would have already evaporated.
