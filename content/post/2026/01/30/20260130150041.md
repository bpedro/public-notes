Interesting approach by Adam Altman from Redocly. The concept of "unforced errors" is quite interesting.

>In API design and documentation, unforced errors look like this:
>
>- an endpoint that behaves differently than described
>- a parameter marked optional that's actually required
>- error responses that aren't documented or actionable
>- examples that don't compile, don't run, or don't match reality
>- concepts explained, but not when or why to use them
>
>None of these require a competitor. None require scale. None require bad actors.

Near the end of the article, Adam asks if the API works as expected, without surprises. That immediately made me think of my [API Hierarchy of Needs](https://apiux.com/2013/05/29/api-hierarchy-needs/) (2013), where its second layer ("Functionality") asks something similar.
