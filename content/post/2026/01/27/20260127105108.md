> You might be asking yourself, "Wait, isn’t the agent loop *quadratic* in terms of the amount of JSON sent to the Responses API over the course of the conversation?" And you would be right. While the Responses API does support an optional `previous_response_id`⁠ parameter to mitigate this issue, Codex does not use it today, primarily to keep requests fully stateless and to support Zero Data Retention (ZDR) configurations.
