>So what can you actually do with Clawdbot Control access?
>
>Read access gets you the complete configuration, which includes every credential the agent uses: API keys, bot tokens, OAuth secrets, signing keys.
>
>You can pull the full conversation history across every integrated platform, meaning months of private messages and file attachments, everything the agent has seen. That alone would be worth the effort for most attackers.
