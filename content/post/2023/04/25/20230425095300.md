> We're going to need a standard for proving that a piece of media comes from a real camera. We're going to need a trustable way to tell if an image has been generated or modified, and by which software. This can be achieved using cryptographic signatures. Each hardware and software that creates or modifies a piece of media can sign it with a private key, leaving a digital trace behind. There is ongoing work in that field, a promising one being the [Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/index.html).
