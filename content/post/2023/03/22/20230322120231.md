> The MACH Alliance is a not-for-profit industry body that advocates for open and best-of-breed enterprise technology ecosystems. The Alliance aims to educate and support the industry as a whole on what to look out for when moving from legacy infrastructure and going composable, including when, where and how to start and select partners. Our role is more important than ever as adoption of MACH continues apace. The Alliance is a vendor-neutral institution that provides resources, education and guidance through industry experts to support companies on their journey.
