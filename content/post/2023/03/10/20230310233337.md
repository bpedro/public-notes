> Contract testing will only get you so far, but it will get you a lot further down the road than functional testing. The nuance here is really in the detail of what API functionality is at an API, business, or industry level. Most people I encounter who push back on the notion of contract testing are only operating at the API level, or in a very narrow view of business.
