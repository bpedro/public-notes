Postman Open Technologies Knowledge Base is an experimental project dedicated to mining and extracting knowledge from across the API universe. This is a Postman Visualizer that consumes a mock of the Knowledge Base API. The goal of this Visualizer is to allow stakeholders to see the Knowledge Base data visually and provide feedback that leads to improvements in the API design.
