> What if you could use natural language to create software? What if you could leverage the power of a large-scale language model that can generate code, data, and text from simple prompts? What if you could balance the trade-offs between leverage and precision, uncertainty and interaction, complexity and simplicity? These are some of the questions that Sam Schillace, a software engineer and entrepreneur, explored when he had early access to GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s generative pre-trained transformer model.

Microsoft’s Deputy CTO [Sam Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/) developed nine principles for using LLMs to create software:

1. Don’t write code if the model can do it; the model will get better, but the code won’t.
2. Trade leverage for precision; use interaction to mitigate.
3. Code is for syntax and process; models are for semantics and intent.
4. The system will be as brittle as its most brittle part.
5. Ask Smart to Get Smart.
6. Uncertainty is an exception throw.
7. Text is the universal wire protocol.
8. Hard for you is hard for the model.
9. Beware pareidolia of consciousness; the model can be used against itself.
