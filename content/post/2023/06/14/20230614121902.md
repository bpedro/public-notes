I [updated the Knowledge Base API query](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/commit/5e84b76c333e23b16f0550a09f38e0475098bb7a) behind the `/reports` endpoint. The previous query was taking too long to process, sometimes over 10 seconds. Now I'm using a materialized view that produces results almost instantly. It didn't make sense to wait ~10 seconds to get a list of available report types, something that doesn't change often.
