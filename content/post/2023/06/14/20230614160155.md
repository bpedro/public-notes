I wish I had time to read all the books I want to read.

Rick Rubin's [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/The-Creative-Act/dp/1838858636) looks like a great read. Seth Godin's latest book about the meaning of work, [The Song of Significance](https://www.amazon.com/Song-Significance-New-Manifesto-Teams/dp/0593715543), is attracting me.

One is Nadia Eghbal's [Working in Public](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862). Then there's Michael S. Malone's [The Big Score](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092MSL7NX). And also Andrew Chen's [The Cold Start Problem](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HZ5XY7X). And a few more...

I wish I had more time to read. More.
