> _Blind Camera_ is an AI powered device that generates pictures from sound instead of light while preserving the experience of using a point-and-shoot camera. The horn is aimed at a sound and with the push of a button it's converted into an image. Images are therefore framed with ears instead of eyes since the camera can hear but cannot see. The resulting 'photo' is indexical of the surrounding soundscape and not of the scene in front of the camera.
