> he tradeoffs that are represented by product thinking are more nuanced than the tradeoffs represented by architecture thinking. I think versioning is a very solid architectural pattern that guarantees stability in the case of breaking changes. There are always needs for that pattern. Mountebank itself has enough debt underneath it. One of these days, I would like to release a subsequent version that allows me to remove a lot of the cruft, a lot of the things I really no longer want to support, but have to because of some of these backwards compatible transformations that I'm doing.
