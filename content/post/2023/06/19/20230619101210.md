How can API changes break integrations?  
  
Here's a very interesting thought from a discussion I had last week about API changelogs: "Once you know someone is using your API, you're going to try to keep it stable."  
  
Interestingly, this is also the reality that I know of. In many situations, producers fear making changes to APIs once they realize they have consumers. Producers stop iterating on their API design, missing the opportunity to publish improvements.

It shouldn't have to be like this. I feel there's an opportunity for improvement here. As a producer, you should be able to make changes to your API without fearing breaking consumption.  
  
Can we achieve this state? We have the technology and the brains to make it happen. Who's already working on this challenge?
