{{% marginnote %}}Found on [Why we created Taxi, and why we felt the need for Another Schema Language - Orbital](https://orbitalhq.com/blog/2023-05-12-why-we-created-taxi) on 2023-05-17 10:29:12 +02:00.{{% /marginnote %}}

> TaxiQL is part of the [Taxi Spec](https://github.com/taxilang/taxilang/blob/develop/compiler/src/main/antlr4/lang/taxi/Taxi.g4) - itâ€™s a query language that lets consumers ask for data they want using the same semantic types that producers have embedded in their API specs.

It's interesting to see another query language popping up. The company behind it, [Orbital](https://orbitalhq.com/), evaluated several alternatives and didn't find anything that would be a good fit. They mention that with Taxi, software can orchestrate automation between APIs *automagically*.
