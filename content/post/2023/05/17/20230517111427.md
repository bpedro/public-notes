> There are 3 different ways that teams can create personas, depending on the research data in which they are rooted:
>
>1. **Proto personas**, meant to quickly align the team’s existing [assumptions](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/tracking-assumptions/) about who their users are, but not based on (new) research
>2. **Qualitative personas**, based on small-sample qualitative research, such as interviews,  usability tests, or [field studies](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/field-studies/)
>3. **Statistical personas**, where initial qualitative research informs a survey instrument that is used to gather a large sample size, and the personas emerge from statistical analysis
