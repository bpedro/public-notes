Postman Open Technologies [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base) is an experimental project dedicated to mining and extracting knowledge from across the API universe. This is a prototype UI that consumes an early version of the Knowledge Base API. The goal of this prototype UI is to allow stakeholders to explore interacting with the Knowledge Base API and provide feedback that leads to improvements in the API design.

The prototype was built using [Retool](https://retool.com/) and required almost no coding. The only thing I had to change was the response format of the statistics endpoint to make it work well with Retool's chart component.
