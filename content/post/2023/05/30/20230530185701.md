> The camera operates by collecting data from its location using open APIs. Utilising the address, weather, time of day, and nearby places, _Paragraphica_ creates a paragraph that details a representation of the current place and moment. Using a text-to-image API, the camera converts the paragraph into a unique visualization. The resulting “photo” is not just a snapshot, but a complex and nuanced reflection of the location you are at.
