Following my experiment with creating a prototype for the Open Technologies Knowledge Base using [Retool](https://retool.com/), I tried using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I can't say I had a good experience. First of all, Figma feels *complicated*. Also, there's no clear way to make a prototype work with live data. There are plugins that help you pull data from an API into a Figma component. However, the data then remains static during the lifetime of the prototype, unless you refresh it manually. I'll continue investigating to see if there's a better approach than the one I've been trying.
