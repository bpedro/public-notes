In-person meetings and conferences have better results than remote ones.

> Scientists who have attended meetings are more likely to cite work discussed in talks they could see in person, compared with results described in sessions that they could not attend[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01604-x#ref-CR1). That citation bump from in-person attendance accrues even for talks that conference attendees hadnâ€™t planned on listening to.
