> The **hyper** utility is a simple command-line style shell/REPL for interacting with an online services/APIs. While a fully-functional HTTP client, **hyper** is especially good at dealing with hypermedia services including [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/), [SIREN](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren), and [HAL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08). There are plans to add support for [PRAG+JSON](https://mamund.github.io/prag-json/), [MASH+JSON](https://mamund.github.io/mash-json), and possibly [UBER](http://uberhypermedia.com/) in the future.
