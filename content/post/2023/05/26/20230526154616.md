I'm seeing a pattern in the VC space lately. From conversations that I've been having with different operators, it looks like there's lots of cash waiting to be deployed. Most of the cash is ready to be used on pre-seed and seed-stage projects, while there's also some available for later stages. It feels like the funds have not been totally depleted yet.
