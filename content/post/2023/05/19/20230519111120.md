Another interesting query language, with goals similar to ESQL from Elastic.

> Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) is a powerful tool to explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and more based on data stored in [Dynatrace Grail storage](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform/grail/dynatrace-grail).
> 
> DQL offers maximum flexibility because it is built for processing arbitrary event data, requiring no up-front description of the input data's schema contrary to relational databases like SQL tables.
