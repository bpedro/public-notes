I [first wrote](https://apiux.com/2013/05/29/api-hierarchy-needs/) about the API Hierarchy of Needs in 2013. I got inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of needs and defined the layered needs of an API consumer.

{{< figure src="/media/API hierarchy of needs.png" title="The API hierarchy of needs" caption="Inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the pyramid represents the layered needs of API consumers by order of importance." >}}

The layers are stacked by order of importance, with the one with the most priority at the very bottom.

- **Usability**: is your API easy to use by new consumers?
- **Functionality**: does your API work as advertised?
- **Reliability**: does your API perform consistently over time?
- **Proficiency**: does your API increase the skills of consumers?
- **Creativity**: can your API be used in unexpected and creative ways?
