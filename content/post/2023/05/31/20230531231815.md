> [The AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/) is a proposed European law on artificial intelligence (AI) â€“ the first law on AI by a major regulator anywhere. The law assigns applications of AI to three risk categories. First, applications and systems that create an **unacceptable risk**, such as government-run social scoring of the type used in China, are banned. Second, **high-risk applications**, such as a CV-scanning tool that ranks job applicants, are subject to specific legal requirements. Lastly, applications not explicitly banned or listed as high-risk are largely left unregulated.
