Product discovery calls are a crucial part of a successful API.  
  
Continuing my journey of building the apidays public API, I've been interacting with a few of you on product discovery calls.

First, I want to thank all those that have scheduled calls with me. I've been learning a lot from the challenges and opinions that you've been sharing about apidays and conferences, in general.

So far I'm seeing a few interesting patterns. However, I still want to have more calls to be able to crystallize my findings into potential benefits and features.
