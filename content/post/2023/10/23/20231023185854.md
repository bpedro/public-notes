Last week I had a great call with Alexandre Airvault from [Blobr](https://blobr.io). During the call, he showed me their latest product: an "AI copilot" that connects to your APIs and lets users engage in a conversational way.

The technology lets you connect your OpenAPI definition to an engine that streamlines the process of interacting with AI and establishing the conversational UI. All amazing to see and done beautifully.

However, what impresses me is how technologies such as the one Alex is building create a new kind of UI that is not based on commands. Instead, users can define what they want and the system makes that happen for them.

Another example is what Dario Di Carlo is building with [Bricks](https://bricks.sh). While Blobr makes an API available through a conversation, Bricks lets you connect to several APIs and orchestrate tasks following an intent-based approach.

I know this is just the beginning and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. I can't wait to see how the combination of APIs and AI will evolve to deliver intent-based UIs in the future.
