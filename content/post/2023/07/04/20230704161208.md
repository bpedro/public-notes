Why are naming conventions important in API Design?

By using naming conventions you're make your API consistent with the industry standards. Your API users will find it easier to understand your API. Your developers will find it easier to implement and maintain your API. Most tooling will work better when naming conventions are used.  

Here are some examples of naming conventions across different types of APIs:

- Plural nouns to represent REST resources, e.g., `/articles`.
- Use of HTTP verbs to access REST endpoints, e.g., `POST /articles`.
- Singular nouns to represent data types in GraphQL, e.g., `Article`.
- Use of verbs for GraphQL mutations, e.g., `CreateArticle`.
- Using the word "service" to identify gRPC services, e.g., `ArticleService`.
- Verb-noun structure to define event names in asynchronous APIs, e.g., `ArticleCreated`.
