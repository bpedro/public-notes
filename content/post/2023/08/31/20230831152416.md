*   First, the Dockerfile file format for declaratively describing a machine (operating system, installed packages, processes, etc).
*   Second, the Docker Engine which takes a Dockerfile and runs it on a Linux host natively, without a virtual machine.
*   Third, the Docker Desktop app which takes a Dockerfile and runs it on a Mac or Windows host, using a Linux virtual machine.
*   Fourth, the Docker Hub container repository which allows a community to share Dockerfiles for common configurations.
