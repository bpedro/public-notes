It's interesting that API Product Management is gaining adepts. The trend reminds me of something I wrote in 2019 about non-technical API Design tools:

> Why arenâ€™t companies building API Design tools that make it easier for non-technical people to collaborate in the API Design activities?

I feel that these tools aren't yet available. Why not?
