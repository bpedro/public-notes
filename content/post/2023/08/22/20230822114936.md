summary: My five rules for life.
---

1. Always be ready to reinvent yourself. *Stay foolish for as long as you can, always in learning mode.*
2. Act immediately when you feel inspired. *Take advantage of your mood to act, don't overthink it.*
3. Don't adjust yourself to please others. *Be yourself, follow your own rules, live with the consequences.*
4. Be minimal about the things you need. *Don't overspend on things you don't really need, live a frugal life.*
5. Own your life. *Don't be a slave to a wage, be a master of your time and your life.*
