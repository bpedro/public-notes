> PBers[^1] favor **speed and immediacy** over accuracy and constancy. PBers are generally more concerned about trying to manage short-term comfort than long-term effectiveness in solving important problems. So, to control their emotions, they procrastinate and block.â€”in PROCRASTINATION AND BLOCKING: A Novel, Practical Approach, Robert Boice
