I'm building an API product for the [apidays](https://www.apidays.global/) conferences.

I'm starting my journey of building a new API. After a great discussion with Mehdi Medjaoui, we aligned on the vision for what is to become the apidays API:

> To offer the best possible experience to attendees before, during, and after a conference.

I already have some ideas for features but I won't get ahead of myself. Instead, I want to engage with stakeholders—past and future conference attendees, speakers, and organizers—to learn their challenges and how the API can help them.

I'm working in public so I'll be sharing my progress here with pointers to any code, documentation, and other assets produced during the process.
