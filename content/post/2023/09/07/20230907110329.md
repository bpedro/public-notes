**New LoRa world record: 1336 km / 830 mi**

> After 3 years, the new world record was set by installing LoRaWAN trackers on a fishing boat [Estrela de Sesimbra](https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=8797219) and on its buoys on the Sesimbra coast, Portugal. The tracker was able to make contact with a gateway in the Canarian Islands. Three messages have been received by the _“cablpa-pitilleros”_ gateway connected to The Things Stack Community Edition.
