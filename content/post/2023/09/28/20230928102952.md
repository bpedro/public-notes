I'm starting my journey building the apidays public API.

I'm already doing a few API product discovery calls with some of you and I'm looking forward to scheduling more interviews.

As a part of my journey, I've created a GitHub repository that I'm using to capture all the details of the process—and the code itself once I get to that part. This is a work-in-progress project, so expect lots of changes to that repo. I follow the release-early-release-often approach.

You can obviously contribute. To do that, go to the GitHub repository and create an API product discovery interview issue so I can follow up and schedule a call: https://github.com/bpedro/apidays-api
