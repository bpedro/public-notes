What increases the retention of users consuming your API?

Developer Experience (DX) influences acquisition and activation, value exchange (VX) influences monetization, and user experience (UX) influences retention.

One way UX increases retention is by reducing the friction regular users find to start and keep using your API. One way to reduce friction is by choosing the right architectural style based on what users need, not on your preferences. Another way is to use authentication and authorization mechanisms that are simple to understand and use, such as OAuth.

OAuth provides the easiest form of authentication and authorization for users who want to integrate your API with the tools they already use. By being able to securely have your API working inside their favorite tools, users will keep using your API regularly with little or no friction at all.
