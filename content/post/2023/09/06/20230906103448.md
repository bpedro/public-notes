DX, VX, or API UX? Which one is more important?  
  
This is how I see it:  
  
- DX drives acquisition: Most developers only interact with your API once when they're building the integration code. After that, the integration (hopefully) keeps running and developers won't interact with your API again.  
  
- VX drives revenue: By aligning your API with your business objectives you'll have a better chance of monetizing and generating revenue. Without VX you can have a fantastic API but you might not be able to sustain it from a business perspective.  
  
And, finally, my favorite:  
  
- API UX drives retention: Consumers (not just developers) have been interacting with APIs more and more on a regular basis. AI is an excellent example of how non-technical people can use APIs regularly, sometimes without even realizing it. A negative API UX introduces friction makes it hard for consumers to obtain value from the API, and increases churn.  
  
As an organization, I'd say that these three experiences are essential. However, prioritizing the one that matters the most to you is crucial to find success.  
  
So, ask yourself where you are in your API program and select which experience you should focus on to achieve results.
