> Incentive theory explains that behavior is driven by desire for reinforcements and rewards. Can we use this to make APIs easier to use and more trustworthy? API scores and scoreboards can incentivize good API practices: APIs are rewarded for having a good security score, a high design score, and other factors that organizations think are important for good APIs. API scores bring attention to things that organizations care about and help people find ways to improve APIs.
