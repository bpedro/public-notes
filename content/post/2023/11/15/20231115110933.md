> Chat Completions are non-deterministic by default (which means model outputs may differ from request to request). That being said, we offer some control towards deterministic outputs by giving you access to the [seed](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-seed) parameter and the [system\_fingerprint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/object#completions/object-system_fingerprint) response field.
