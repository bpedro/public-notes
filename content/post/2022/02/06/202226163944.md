> The “API Economy” is a popular term among VC’s and tech media, but I find it curiously unappreciated by developers. I think this is partly because developers know this revolution by other names (“SaaS” or “Devtools”) and partly because the term is _more_ popular among nontechnical audiences. **This causes developers to severely underestimate the importance of the API Economy to their own careers.**
