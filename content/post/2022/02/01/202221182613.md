> _The World After Capital_ has two goals. The first is to establish that we are currently experiencing a third period of globally transformative, non-linear change. The key argument is that each time, the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, the defining constraint for humanity shifts—meaning the allocation problem that most fundamentally needs to be solved in order to meet humanity’s needs changes. Specifically, the invention of agriculture shifted scarcity from food to land, and industrialization shifted scarcity from land to capital (which throughout _The World After Capital_ refers to physical capital, such as machines and buildings, unless otherwise noted). Digital technology is now shifting scarcity from capital to attention.

Interesting book about capitalism and the three freedoms:
-   Economic freedom: instituting a universal basic income.
-   Informational freedom: broadening access to information and computation.
-   Psychological freedom: practicing and encouraging mindfulness.
