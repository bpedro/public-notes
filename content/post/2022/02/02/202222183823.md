{{% marginnote %}}Found at [sinclairzx81typebox: JSON Schema Type Builder with Static Type Resolution for TypeScript](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) on 2022-02-02 18:38:23.{{% /marginnote %}}

> TypeBox is a library that creates in-memory JSON Schema objects that can be statically inferred as TypeScript types. The schemas produced by this library are designed to match the static type checking rules of the TypeScript compiler. TypeBox allows one to create a unified type that can be both statically asserted by the TypeScript compiler and runtime asserted using standard JSON Schema validation.
