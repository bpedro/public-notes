> The hard part of an API is not to use it, but to _learn_ it. After learning how the API works, typing out the commands is not hard. But when you first time you encounter an API, a million questions pop into your mind: What is this object for? Is there a parameter for that? Can the API do X? Learning requires effort, but the more the developer learns, the more problems they can solve. We can imagine the developers climbing a ladder where, for every step they take up the “learning ladder”[3](https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/2022-01-24-apis-as-ladders/#fn-3), the more problems they can solve.
