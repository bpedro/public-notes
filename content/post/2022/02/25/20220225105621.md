> API Terms of Service are a key element of todayâ€™s digital infrastructure. Indeed, everytime you use a Software-as-a-Service via its API, you now integrate the technical contract represented by the interface itself. But behind it, you are also accepting the business and legal contract represented by the rights allowed in copying or consuming that interface.
