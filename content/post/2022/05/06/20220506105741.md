> Especially for web-applications, it's sensible to split the frontend (data-presentation, user-I/O) from the "real" application. This cleanly separates the presentation from the logic, and (additionally to the advantages above) simplifies the creation/use of alternative frontends and last but not least improves security because the frontend (usually running with webserver-rights) doesn't have direct access to the data, but may only call some functions of an other process.
