> In this emerging server abstraction layer, JavaScript takes the place of Shell. It is quite a bit better suited to scripting than Bash or Zsh. Instead of invoking Linux executables, like shell does, the JavaScript sandbox can invoke Wasm. If you have some computational heavy lifting, like image resizing, it probably makes sense to use Wasm rather than writing it in JS. Just like you wouldn’t write image resizing code in bash, you’d spawn imagemagick.
