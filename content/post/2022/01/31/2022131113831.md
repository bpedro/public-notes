> When an organization strategically envisions APIs as engines for new products, new business channels, and new business models in ways that ultimately produce new revenue or other measurable value, that organization is said to be monetizing its APIs. In aggregate, the organizations around the world that directly or indirectly monetize their APIs form the basis of what the media often calls the “[API economy](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api-economy).” As a subset of the total global economy, the API economy is annually responsible for the exchange of trillions of dollars.
