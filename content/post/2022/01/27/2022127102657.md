{{% marginnote %}}Found at "[Inter-parameter dependencies in REST APIs | by Alberto Martín López | ISA Group | Medium](https://medium.com/isa-group/inter-parameter-dependencies-in-rest-apis-4664e901c124)" on 2022-01-27 10:26:57.{{% /marginnote %}}

> REST APIs often include dependency constraints that restrict how two or more parameters can be combined to form valid API calls. These _inter-parameter dependencies_ make it difficult to automatically interact with the services, since API specification languages offer little or no support for them. We carried out a study on 40 industrial APIs and found that 85% of them contain inter-parameter dependencies. More importantly, we classified all the dependencies found (over 600) into seven patterns, serving as the basis for future proposals for modeling and analyzing inter-parameter dependencies automatically.
