According to the author, the bottleneck can be fixed by identifying the "First Team."

> The First Team mindset was defined [by Patrick Lencioni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPXI2bPZTOo) and referenced in many of his works including [The Advantage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470941529/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470941529&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20) and [The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team: A Leadership Fable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787960756/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0787960756&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20), and while it’s typically used in relation with the establishment of cross-functional leadership teams as the primary accountability team rather than organizational reports, the same concept is applicable here for product teams.
