> I truly loathe Markdown. Truly. But given the widespread use of Markdown, it might seem strange that I have such aversion to it. If you somehow really like it, or are so used to it by now, you might be tempted to think I'm the oddball.

Interesting opinion. To me, Markdown is not a format. Instead, it's a way of writing that follows a limited set of conventions and can be easily extended. The amount of conventions—or features—that you can use depends on the tool that you're using to render the Markdown content.
