I recently [asked a question](https://twitter.com/bpedro/status/1581731185696206848) on twitter:

> What's the analog of a low-fidelity mockup for API Design? What tool would you use? Why would it be useful?

I wasn't expecting much. However, I received a bunch of replies. Most people focused on answering what they're using for API Design, and not necessarily for doing low-fidelity mockups. Here's a list of ideas that people shared:

- [Darrel Mirrel](https://twitter.com/darrel_miller) [shares](https://twitter.com/darrel_miller/status/1581756813443072001) that he uses [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) graph diagrams to design and describe resource URLs.
- [Erik Wilde](https://twitter.com/dret) [writes](https://twitter.com/dret/status/1581806618651394048) that he starts with something he calls "API stories." Those stories inform Erik of the experience that users have while interacting with the API. After figuring out what those stories are, Erik defines how the API will work.
- [Heimo Laukkanen](https://twitter.com/huima) [explains](https://twitter.com/huima/status/1581732342196228096) that he starts by drafting endpoint URLs and descriptions using a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) document. He then uses [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/) mocking to make sense of the API experience before writing any code.
- [Luca Ferrari](https://twitter.com/thekingsback) [shares](https://twitter.com/thekingsback/status/1581923093651783680) that he starts with simple user stories to identify possible endpoints, objects, and interactions.
- [Oscar Islas](https://twitter.com/oislas) [says](https://twitter.com/oislas/status/1581733363387617280) (in Spanish) that he creates an API mock that always returns a static example. To do that, Oscar uses [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). However, Oscar recommends using [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/) for things that are custom and flexible.

It's interesting to see the diversity in approaches to API Design.
