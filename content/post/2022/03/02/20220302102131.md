> I write almost everything important in my life: thoughts, plans, notes, diaries, correspondence, code, articles, and entire books.
>
> They are my extended memory — my noted self — my organized thoughts. I refer to them often. I search them, update them, and learn from them. I convert them into HTML to make websites, or LaTeX to make books.
>
> My written words are my most precious asset. They are also a history of my life. **That’s why I only use plain text files.** They are the most reliable, flexible, and long-lasting option.
