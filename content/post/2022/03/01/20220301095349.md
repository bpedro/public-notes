> In creative work there are two phases: exploration and execution. In the exploration phase, you don’t know what the thing is going to be, you don’t have all of the information or ideas you want to have, you don’t even know if what you’re thinking about is important, and any little breeze in the wrong direction might blow you off course. In the execution phase, you are _inspired_, you know what the thing is, you know how to make it, it feels urgent; all you need to do is sit down and do the thing.
