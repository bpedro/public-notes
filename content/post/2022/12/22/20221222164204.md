> The question of who invented the API is a little like asking who discovered Antarctica – the answers are as varied as the parties that submit them, and there’s little agreement as to a hard and fast date. The question becomes even more complex due to the nature of an API (which we will discuss shortly) – that being said, we can at least start with some of the earliest conceptual formations towards the idea of an API with the work of **Wilkes**, **Wheeler**, and **Gill**.
