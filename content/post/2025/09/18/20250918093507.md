I've been chatting with [David Biesack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbiesack/), the Chief API Officer at [Apiture](https://www.apiture.com/), a digital banking startup in the US. Apiture offers a set of digital financial features to banks through APIs. They also connect financial partners to banks through their platform. Biesack shared that they onboard new partners to use their APIs manually. They do have a public [developer portal](https://dx.apiture.com/) that potential partners find through Google searches. They use the information on the developer portal to educate partners and their developer teams on how to integrate with their APIs.
