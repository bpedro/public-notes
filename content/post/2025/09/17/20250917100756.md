summary: API Discovery reality in the Brazilian banking industry
---
I recently had a chat with [Vinicius Marques](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viniciusmarques/), a Brazilian banking technology professional, about what it means to be an API producer in his field of expertise. Initially, I just wanted to know what the banking industry is doing to attract consumers to their APIs. What he told me was quite interesting. In general, banks have a public API portal where developers can see what APIs are available. The public portal also has API documentation, which, according to Marques, it's quite hard to keep up to date. Most developers find those APIs through Google searches. Some of them get in after consulting the Brazilian Central Bank API directory.
