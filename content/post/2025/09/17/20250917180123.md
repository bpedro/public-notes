summary: API Discovery reality in the Portuguese health sector
---
I just had a chat with [Bruno Amaral](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunoamaral/), the founder of Gregory AI, a medical research assistant software. Amaral runs a version of the assistant dedicated to [multiple sclerosis](https://gregory-ms.com/). This assistant offers information about research articles and their authors. Amaral told me that he wishes there were an API directory so he could publish the assistant API there. For now, he has to contact developers directly to show them how the API works. There are two other research projects based on the same technology that could benefit from publicizing their APIs properly. One is dedicated to [brain regeneration](https://research.regenerar.eu/), and the other one to [encephalitis](https://investigacao.encefalites.pt/) (in Portuguese, mostly).
