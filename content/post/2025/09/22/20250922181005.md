summary: Interesting workflow metrics
---
I've been researching the importance of workflow metrics. Here's a short list of the most important metrics I'm considering:

- **Execution success vs. failure rates** (overall reliability).
- **Average execution time** (per workflow and per step/node).
- **Throughput** (workflows/minute or executions/day).
- **Error frequency and error type distribution** (identifying failing connectors, steps, or APIs).
- **Resource utilization** (CPU, memory, cost implications for high-volume workflows).
- **Queue length / latency** (how long items wait before processing).
- **Retries and recovery events** (resilience of workflows).
- **Custom business metrics** (e.g. number of invoices processed, leads captured, etc., tied to workflows).

This is quite an interesting area, definitely worth more exploration.
