Last month was very quiet here, not because I wasn't doing anything, but because I chose not to publish here as much. Here's a summary of different things I published in August 2025 elsewhere:

- [Full API MCP Exposure vs. Specific Workflows](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/full-api-mcp-exposure-vs-specific-workflows) on August 29, about the differences between exposing a full API through an MCP server in comparison to picking a handful of workflows.
- [Machine-Oriented Use-Case Documentation](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/machine-oriented-use-case-documentation) on August 22, exploring ways of making multi-step API use cases understandable by AI agents.
- [Enterprise MCP Authorization](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/enterprise-mcp-authorization) on August 15, about the choices you have to add authorization to an MCP server.
- [Connecting AI to APIs in a Standard Way](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/connecting-ai-to-apis-in-a-standard-way) on August 13, showing how you can use API unification in combination with MCP to make it easy to connect AI to external tools.
- [Documenting Your API Around Its Capabilities](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/documenting-your-api-around-its-capabilities) on August 8, about the importance of documenting capabilities in making consumers understand what an API does.
