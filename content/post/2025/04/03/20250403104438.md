How do you document the processes behind API Governance?  
  
I've been thinking about this for a while. It feels easy to document API definitions, style guides, linting rules, lifecycle transitions, and other artifacts.  
  
On the other hand, I couldn't find a simple way to document the interactions between stakeholders during API Governance processes. Until now.  
  
I feel that Service Design can play a big role here. In particular, Service Blueprints can be the way to document API Governance processes.
