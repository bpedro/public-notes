> Everyone agrees that having a high-quality API is critical. However, most people who run APIs don't know how to measure quality. To them, "quality" is something subjective. So, they can say if an API has good quality but they aren't able to quantify it. To me, quality is the "glue" between all the stakeholders of an API. If you're a consumer you naturally care about the quality of an API. If you're the API producer, you want it to have the best possible quality. If you're a developer, you're interested in building something that is high quality. If you're a business decision-maker, you want the API quality to represent your products and your company. So, if API quality is something everyone is interested in, what is it exactly? Follow me as I explore its meaning.
