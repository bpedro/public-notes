summary: Code-On-Demand REST constraint
---
> REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented.â€”Roy Thomas Fielding and Richard N. Taylor. 2000. Architectural styles and the design of network-based software architectures. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of California, Irvine.
