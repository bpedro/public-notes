> Computers really didn't start making an impact in the Design community until the late 80s. At the time, a lot of the OG designers of that era were vehemently opposed to using the computer. They were certain that we were going to lose jobs. It was going to take all the creativity out of the process, out of the way in which we created. It was going to create soulless work.â€”Debbie Millman, during the New York chapter of CreativeMornings on Dec 5, 2024, in conversation with Seth Godin
