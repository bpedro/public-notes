OpenAI's announcement of their Computer-Using Agent (CUA) mentions APIs a few times. However, it shows that **not needing to use APIs** is a benefit and something to aim for. The first mention states that there's an increased flexibility in bypassing any APIs and instead using Web apps directly.

> This gives it the flexibility to perform digital tasks **without using OS- or web-specific APIs**.

The second mention of APIs shows examples of how flexible the CUA is because it doesn't need to interact with APIs.

> CUA (...) uses a virtual mouse and keyboard to complete actions. This enables CUA to act in a wide range of digital environments, performing tasks like filling out forms and navigating websites **without needing specialized APIs**.

The third mention of APIs hints at how the CUA can grow in usage over time. And, not using APIs is what makes that growth possible.

> By **moving beyond specialized agent-friendly APIs**, CUA can adapt to whatever computer environment is available

Finally—and ironically—the announcement mentions that the CUA itself will be available through OpenAI's own API.

> We're also working to make CUA available in the API, so developers can use it to build their own computer-using agents
