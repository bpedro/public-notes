> Agents depend on APIs as much as AI. Chatbots chat, but agents act, and they act through APIs: checking calendars, booking flights, analyzing data, reconciling accounts, and controlling smart buildings. To realize this potential, we must build a common knowledge foundation that empowers AI to interact with the world's APIs reliably and without artificial barriers or unnecessary intermediaries.
