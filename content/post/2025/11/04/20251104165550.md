> In recent months Jentic joined the [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)](https://openapis.org/). The move is deliberate. Our strategy is to bring enterprise API landscapes into the AI age, and to enable agents to reliably and securely use an organization's capabilities. This requires a standards bedrock that both developers and agents can rely on without guesswork, and this is something that OAI's standards provide.
