summary: API specification vs. format
---
What do people understand when they read "API specification?" I feel most people think it refers to the API description document. Most people simply call the API description the *spec*. In that case, what do they call the type of specification, e.g., OpenAPI, AsyncAPI? We should call it a *format*.

Here are the two definitions that matter:

- **API specification**: a formal, structured document that describes how an API works, what it can do, how to use it, and what developers should expect from it.
- **API format**: how the API itself is documented or modeled, including its structure, endpoints, data types, and authentication. Popular API formats include OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL SDL, and Protocol Buffers.
