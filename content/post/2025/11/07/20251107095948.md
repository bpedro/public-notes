summary: People don't want to write code
---
Simulating an API often requires some logic code. People don't want to write that code, and they prefer to invest their time implementing the API, not working on a simulation.

One of the challenges with API prototyping with simulations is the time it takes between writing the simulation logic code and seeing it working. My hypothesis is that unless the prototyping is done in an interactive session, people won't want to spend their time writing simulation code.
