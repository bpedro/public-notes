summary: Cognitive deficit while being a polyglot
---
If the definition of a polyglot is "aÂ person who knows and is able to use several languages," then I'm definitely one. Not just that, but I have to use several languages on a daily basis just to go through the day. At home, I use Portuguese, at work, I use Spanish and English (both written and spoken), and in the street, I use Spanish. Even though I have lived in Spain since August 2011, I never took the time to learn proper Spanish simply because I never needed to. Until last year. Where I now work, most people speak only Spanish, so communicating without using it would be a major barrier. Every single day, I learn a few words in Spanish and some more work-related expressions. What usually happens is that I get a heavy load of what I call "cognitive deficit," which is the lack of ability to think properly after a few hours of using a language that still doesn't feel native.
