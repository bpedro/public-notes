summary: The fountain is, in fact, a urinal
---
Readymades, or _objets trouvés_ in French, are items artists find that aren't normally used to produce art. Artists use those items to create art pieces such as _collages_ in visual art and sample-based music.

Using readymades was popularized by artist Duchamp. Three examples of popular Duchamp readymades are the "Fontaine," the "Porte bouteille," and the "Roue the bicyclette." The "Fontaine" is, in fact, a urinal. However, the artist calls it a "fountain."
