summary: This is how I write

This is how I write, in five simple steps:

1. **The problem**: show readers that there's a serious problem that needs to be fixed.
2. **A possible solution**: explore one or more possible solutions to the problem.
3. **Solving the problem**: tell the story of how to solve the problem using one of the possible solutions.
4. **Drawback**: show that the solution is not perfect, after all, and present its disadvantages.
5. **Final decision**: decide if readers should stay with the problem or opt for the proposed solution.
