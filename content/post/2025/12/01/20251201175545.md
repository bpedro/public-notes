Dieter Rams designed the Vitsoe 606 universal shelving system in 1960, when he was 28. The company has been manufacturing and selling the system ever since. The idea is fabulous. A system that you can use to hang any kind of shelf, table-top, or drawer. It grows with you. And, its quality makes it outlive you.
