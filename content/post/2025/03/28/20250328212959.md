> Large language models display impressive capabilities. However, for the most part, the mechanisms by which they do so are unknown. The black-box nature of models is increasingly unsatisfactory as they advance in intelligence and are deployed in a growing number of applications. Our goal is to reverse engineer how these models work on the inside, so we may better understand them and assess their fitness for purpose.
