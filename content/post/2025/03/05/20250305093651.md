"Nobody came of their own will," is the key sentence to remember. Slaves were transported like cargo. According to the "[A terrible passage from Africa](https://web.archive.org/web/20240906020708/https://www.reuters.com/graphics/AFRICA-SLAVERY-SHIPS/0100B0CV0SB/)" article (from where the following picture was taken), between 1514 and 1866 more than 12.5 million people were transported from Africa to America.
