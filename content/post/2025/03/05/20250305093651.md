summary: Our ancestors arrived many years ago from the African continent
---
> Our ancestors arrived many years ago from the African continent. **Nobody came of their own will.** When the slave ships arrived, families were separated. And each family member would keep a piece of cloth that represented their tribe or family.

"Nobody came of their own will," is the key sentence to remember. Slaves were transported like cargo. According to the "[A terrible passage from Africa](https://web.archive.org/web/20240906020708/https://www.reuters.com/graphics/AFRICA-SLAVERY-SHIPS/0100B0CV0SB/)" article (from where the following picture was taken), between 1514 and 1866 more than 12.5 million people were transported from Africa to America.

The "piece of cloth" the video refers to is represented today by the "Pavilhão." It's a flag carried during the Carnival celebrations in Brazil to remember and honor the slaves. It's a very important symbol because it identifies the samba school that carries it.
