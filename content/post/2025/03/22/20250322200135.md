Interesting perspective on what is true and what isn't. I tend to agree that what other people share isn't necessarily the truth. It's simply their perspective.

> Beliefs are perspectives. Explanations are confabulated. Obligations are wishes. Rules are arbitrary. Theyâ€™re **useful**, but not necessarily **true**.

"[Useful Not True](https://sive.rs/u)" is the latest [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/)' book. However, it's not the most interesting one, I'm told. Apparently, "[Hell Yeah Or No](https://sive.rs/n)" is much better. I think I'm ordering both.
