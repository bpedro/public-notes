summary: Medium stopped supporting new API integrations
---
It's been a long time since I last published something on [Medium](https://bpedro.medium.com/). I remember when I used to publish short notes, so I thought of giving it a try again. The *only* thing is that now I publish regularly on different places like my own "[public notes](https://notes.brunopedro.com/)" Website, the [API Changelog newsletter](https://apichangelog.substack.com/), my [Bluesky profile](https://bsky.app/profile/brunopedro.com), and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bpedro/). What I write now is much more scattered than when I used to publish on Medium regularly.

But I'm stubborn.

So, I thought of publishing something on Medium again. However, I want to use the tools I now use to write. I want to be able to publish *to* Medium from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which has been my writing tool of choice for the past two years or so. Before, when I used [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), I remember it had a feature for publishing articles to Medium. I found something similar for Obsidian, the [Post Medium Draft](https://github.com/eebmagic/post-medium-draft) plugin.

After installing the plugin, I went to my Medium settings to get an Integration Token. Medium uses tokens as a way to authenticate API consumers. To my surprise, when I opened the settings option to generate a token, I saw the message, "Please note that you can no longer create any new tokens." What could that mean? I did a quick search and found out [that Medium ](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213480228-API-Importing)[no longer](https://help.hyvelabs.co/article/79-unable-to-obtain-medium-token) [supports API access](https://community.make.com/t/integration-token-issue-with-medium-com/64777). Since January 2025, if you don't have an integration token, you won't be able to use Medium's API.

I'm lucky because I have a couple of integration tokens, so I can still use the API and publish from Obsidian to Medium. However, the situation might change in the future, and I don't think I want to create a habit that I know beforehand will probably end soon.
