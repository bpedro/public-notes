> (...) when you put all your entire API surface and turn it into tools, the funniest thing that happens is first the LLM makes the wrong guess about which \[MCP\] tool to use. And once it realizes that it's done the mistake, there's like this sort of cascade of events where it tries to call so many other tools that it's just not figuring its way towards a solution to the initial prompt or the initial problem.â€”Georges Haidar, August 2025
