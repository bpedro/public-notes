I've been working on this quite controversial article for a while now. It's an *op-ed*-style article where I share my view on the state of open-source API specification standards. It's controversial because it focuses on the relationship that certain people have with the specification standard they help build. It's probable that some people won't like to see it published, so I'm holding it. But, while I'm holding it, I get more information from better sources, and what I really end up doing is improving the article, enriching it, and making its case more obvious to the reader. I feel that the longer I wait, the better the article will get.
