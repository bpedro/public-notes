> (...) it's likely that the people who live in these houses don't know their neighbors because all life either takes place inside the house or they get in the car and they go somewhere else. And there's an exactly analogous picture to this in computation, which is this. These people don't know their neighbors. They're each in their own separate world. They're not engaging with the people around them.
