> A person should be allowed to adapt their interfaces no less than they should be allowed to think. Since it is with these interfaces with which we think, a person is not permitted to think their own thoughts unless they are allowed to construe their interfaces as they wish. Otherwise, they’re left thinking their thoughts but in the manner of another, or worse, they’re left thinking the thoughts of another.
