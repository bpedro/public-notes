I've been thinking a lot lately about the notion of API prototyping and its relationship to API simulation. There are three areas worth spending more time exploring: a) "just-in-time" API prototyping, enabling experimentation during API Design; b) API simulation, enabling the creation of "high-fidelity" API mock-ups that feel like the real thing; and c) the programming language used to add simulation logic to an API prototype.
