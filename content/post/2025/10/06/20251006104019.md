> The most prestigious design schools now concentrate on narrative, on storytelling — the product (that word too would be frowned upon) is less important than the process. The result is a strange situation in which young designers are situated between activism, performative gesture and a residual urge to create which is sublimated into something between journalism, installation, anthropology, sociology and superstition. A large part of design is now a critical field, producing provocations rather than necessarily solutions. It is aimed somewhere else.
