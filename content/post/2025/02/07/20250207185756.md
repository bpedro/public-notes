Here's the definition of "Credible exit," one of atproto's values:

> There should be no technical or social single-point-of-failure for the overall protocol and network. There should be no single organization or individual who can entirely exclude others from the ecosystem (though the ecosystem may _collectively_ exclude bad actors). There should be multiple independent interoperating service providers for each infrastructure component.
