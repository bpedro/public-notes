According to Seth Godin, there are three kinds of quality:

1. Technical.
2. Luxury.
3. Creative magic.

Having technical quality means things work according to specs. Luxury means there's something about the product that makes it special to consumers. This is often what most people understand as *quality*. The third kind of quality is the most interesting one. Creative magic is the less-understood attribute that makes people love your product to the point they feel special when using it. Creative magic is what makes consumers recommend your product.
