Nordic APIs published a review of "[Building an API Product](https://a.co/d/87Qd5AW)."

> These are just a few insights from Pedro’s marvelous book, which is stuffed with practical and actionable advice that’s technical enough for advanced users but legible enough for complete beginners. If you find yourself intrigued after reading this API business product primer, we recommend reading _Building an API Product_ in its entirety. It’s one of the best technical API guides we’ve read in recent memory.
