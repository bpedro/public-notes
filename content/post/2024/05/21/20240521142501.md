{{< figure src="/media/The Change Triangle.png" title="The change triangle" caption="Meta-narratives set change in motion by creating a shared story to work toward. Micro-narratives contribute to, and draw from, this shared story. And mechanisms do the work required for change. But it is the social networks that distribute these narratives and spread the work through the systemâ€”Snowden et. al., 2022 ([PDF](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/10/1/7/pdf))." >}}
