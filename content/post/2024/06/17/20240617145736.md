I've just been invited to be one of the *teachers* on an upcoming product-related training initiative. At first, I felt reluctant because I thought that it would distract me from my lifelong path of learning. But then, slowly, I realized that teaching would be a way for me to learn more. I would learn about the students' experiences, I would learn how to adapt my teaching to their needs, I would learn what other teaches have to show, and I would learn how to teach better. I accepted the invitation and I'm preparing a session on the topic of "API Product."
