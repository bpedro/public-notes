This is exactly how I see AI—and any other technology—unfold. It follows what I call "[The Illusion of Immediacy](https://brunopedro.com/2020/10/05/the-illusion-of-immediacy/)."

> with any new technology, we begin by trying to make it fit the problems we already have, while the incumbents try to make it a feature (hence Google and Microsoft spraying LLMs all over their products in the last year). Then startups use it to unbundle the incumbents (to unbundle search, Oracle or Email), but meanwhile, other startups try to work out what we could build that would be truly native to the new technology.
