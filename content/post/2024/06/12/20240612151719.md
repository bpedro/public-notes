summary: Consuming content directly from the source
---
Lately, I've been feeling I'm not getting enough *juice* from the social media feeds I follow. I don't know if it's the algorithms, the people I'm following, or just my change of appetite.

So, I'm investing more time into subscribing to and aggregating content directly from blogs. I hope that, by consuming directly from the source, I'll be able to get better quality content.
