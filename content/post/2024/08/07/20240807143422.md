How do you unpack the notion of governance that Seth Godin shares? If governance antagonizes with politics, then what are the forces driving it? Is the role of governance to give an excuse to who's leading to enforce their opinions? I don't think so. I wrote about it before and I think governance is what drives quality. In the world of products that's the quality consumers perceive. In the world of politics that's the quality of life of a country or an administrative region.
