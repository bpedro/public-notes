Lately, I've been feeling the internet speed at home is slower than it could be.

I've recently moved and, while before I had a 10Mbps connection in the room where I usually type from, now I have everything wired to reach the maximum available speed. So, I was surprised to get ~100Mbps and not more than that. I finally found what the problem was. I was using a CAT5 Ethernet cable. I quickly replaced it with a CAT5e and the problem was solved. I'm now getting speeds of over 500Mbps, which feels *fast*.
