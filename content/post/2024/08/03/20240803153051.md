Sometimes in life, you're surprised with a situation that takes you a few steps back. Or, all the way to step zero. The first reaction is to panic. To get into a survival mood. To try to get back what you lost at all costs as quickly as you can.

While the change in the situation itself is a fantastic learning opportunity, starting from scratch is a gift. Starting from scratch gives you the chance to reinvent yourself. Of rethinking who you really are. Answering questions such as "Was I doing what I really wanted to be doing?" Or, "Was I being real to what I believe?" More often than not, the answers aren't positive.

That's why I see starting from scratch as a way to be born again. When you have nothing to lose, you're free to do whatever you want. Embracing change is more powerful than fighting it.
