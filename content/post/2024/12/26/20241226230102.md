> This is the dream of [malleable software](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming): editing software at the speed of thought. Starting with just the minimal thing we need for our particular use case, adding things immediately as we come across new requirements. Ending up with a tool thatâ€™s molded to our needs like a leather shoe, not some complicated generic thing designed for a million users.
