> To prevent overload from impacting its products, Meta developed a system called _Defcon_. Defcon provides a set of abstractions that allows incident responders to increase available capacity by turning off features, an idea called _graceful feature degradation_. By dividing product features into different levels of business criticality, Defcon also allows oncallers to take a variety actions depending on the severity of an ongoing incident.
