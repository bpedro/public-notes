summary: When you're creating, you want to see a preview of what you create

Most OpenAPI editors aren't doing what I think they should. They focus on two things: linting the OpenAPI document and rendering an API reference preview. The second thing puts the focus on creating good-looking API references. API creators will, naturally, try to write their OpenAPI documents so that the API reference looks nice.

When you're creating, you want to see a preview of what you create. When you write code, you want to see the output of the code running. When you write a markdown document, you want to see it renderedâ€”either in place or on a new panel. When you write an OpenAPI document, you want to see the API it defines running. What you want is to feel the result of what you're creating.
