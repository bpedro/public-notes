I've been using the first prototype of my API Assistant for a couple of weeks, and it feels like *magic*. The prototype automatically creates an API server based on the content of an OpenAPI document. I don't need to write any code or generate any "server stubs" to have my API running. It just updates itself every time I change the OpenAPI document.
