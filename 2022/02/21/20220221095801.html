<p>Ultimately, anonymity comes down to one thing: Control. You should educate yourself on data privacy and make sure that you know what data youâ€™re sharing and what is possibly out there. For example, did you know that when you send a photo on iMessage, the chances are that the location of that photo is in the metadata? All you have to do is save that photo and swipe up. Now, you have the exact geolocation, the capture time, and the camera type. Or that plenty of you have a profile on Whitepages with your phone number and address freely available?</p>
