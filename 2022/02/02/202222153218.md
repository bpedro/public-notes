> The DNA of companies reflects, in so many ways, the DNA of founders. Jeff had a strong opinion about narratives, which he imprinted onto his senior leadership team, which in turn imprinted it onto front-end managers, which in turn imprinted it onto engineers.

None of this powerpoint-style presentation nonsense.
