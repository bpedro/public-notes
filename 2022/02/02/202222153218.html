<blockquote>
<p>The DNA of companies reflects, in so many ways, the DNA of founders. Jeff had a strong opinion about narratives, which he imprinted onto his senior leadership team, which in turn imprinted it onto front-end managers, which in turn imprinted it onto engineers. And so Jeff created a culture in which if you want to convey an idea to influence others, <strong>you write a 6-pager.</strong> With proper grammar, well-articulated sentences, and well thought-out points backed by data, that gets critiqued and improved round after round of reviews. None of this powerpoint-style presentation nonsense.</p>
