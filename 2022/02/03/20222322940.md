> Today Igalia announces [**Wolvic**](https://wolvic.com), a new browser project with an initial focus of picking up where Firefox Reality leaves off.

> XR (eXtended Reality, an umbrella term for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and similar technologies) systems have advanced quite a bit recently, and experiencing them today is eye-opening. Mozilla invested a lot into R&D in XR in the late 2010s, and in late 2018 they released an experimental browser called Firefox Reality. It was a great entry into the XR field, helping establish what a browser in these devices really looks like, and figure out the unique challenges. Today [weâ€™re excited to take up this experiment and continue this work as a complete project](https://blog.mozilla.org/mozilla/update-on-firefox-reality/).
