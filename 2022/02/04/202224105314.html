<p>We have to consider a wide range of use cases in digital transformation projects. Some of these use cases are short-term interactions such as a user or a system invoking a service and expecting an immediate response. An example would be to getting the list of products under a certain category in a shopping portal. However, there can be a significant number of use cases that require more complex interactions with multiple systems as we discuss below.</p>
