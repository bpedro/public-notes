<p>Exchanging quality of service for investment bandwidth is a key tradeoff within an infrastructure organization, but itâ€™s hardly the only one. Operating an infrastructure organization is maintaining a dynamic balance across many forces. You need to balance tech debt against morale. You need to balance iterating on the usability of your capabilities against delivering them before being crushed by an exponentially scaling problem tomorrow. You also need to balance your budget.</p>
