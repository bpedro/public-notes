<p>The Olivetti Programma 101 is recognized as the world’s first desktop computer commercially produced. A complete computer with RAM (random access memory), CPU (central processing unit), display (only 2 lamps!), keyboard, printer and a “mass storage” device in one 65-pound compact and elegant cabinet. There is no need to connect to any external device, only to AC plug. This is not a simple calculator with some programming capability, it is a true computer that you can also use as a regular calculator. Of course the Programma 101 is quite far from modern PC, but it made possible to use a computer at home, office, school and many other places previously not reached by huge mainframes of that time.</p>
