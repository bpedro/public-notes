> Comlink is description language for autonomous APIs. It allows you to declaratively describe your API integrations in a way that separates the **design-time semantics** from the **run-time implementation details**. In other words, Comlink allows for defining the words we use to describe the capability of an API separate from the details for implementing that capability.
