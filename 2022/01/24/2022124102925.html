<p>This year’s State of the API report covers the largest and most comprehensive survey on APIs, ever. More than 28,000 developers and API professionals shared their thoughts on a range of topics, including their organizations’ development priorities, how they get their work done, and where they see the industry going. We combined this data with data we’ve observed on the Postman API Platform to build a robust picture of the current state—and the future—of APIs.</p>
