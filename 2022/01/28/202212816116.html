<p>Blocks can be highly structured, that is, they can have types. That means that they magically become machine-readable without screen scraping. For example, if you want to create an event block to represent an event on a calendar, you will be able to specify a <em>schema</em> that describes the event data type in a standard way. That way tools like calendars can instantly parse and understand web pages that contain your event block, reliably.</p>

<p>This reminds me of WCM where the dream was essentially the same.</p>
