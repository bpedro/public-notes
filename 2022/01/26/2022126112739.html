<blockquote>
<p>Some people use the term “Web 3.0” to refer only to decentralized blockchain-based networks without considering that all personal websites have essentially the same goals, be they on the regular Internet or on the new blockchain networks. Those who use the term “web 3.0” seem to have forgotten that self-hosted personal websites that run on home servers and are accessible over the regular Internet are inherently decentralized. Unfortunately, despite common goals, some on today’s old Internet are hostile to blockchain technology. I am not sure why. Perhaps this is because we seem to be hard-wired to focus on the new and ignore the old, and owners of personal websites on the regular Internet feel ignored. Perhaps they feel the presence of the new blockchain technology only helps to obscure the fact that personal websites on the regular Internet are likely to become a larger more important part of the Internet of the Future–regardless of whether we call it the “old Internet”, “Web 3.0”, or something else. Perhaps someone should come up with a more descriptive name. Maybe a name like “The Cyberfreedom Network” would attract more attention.</p>
