<p>In many ways, having a high quality, authoritative, human readable, machine readable specification that is used by all major users of existing documentation is a no-brainer. It takes work to set it up and to meet everybody’s requirements and it takes some coordination effort to maintain it in a usable state for all users but, if you can do that, it saves a lot of effort, improves coordination and communication both within the company and outside and it leads to higher quality products.</p>
