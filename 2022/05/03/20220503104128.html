<blockquote>
<p><strong>API-First</strong>: This is an increasingly promoted approach. Basically, it means that your organization treats APIs as the core focus with the understanding that they are critical business assets upon which the organization operates. This process is initiated with a contract written in an API description language such as OpenAPI. There’s nothing wrong with this way, and it’s wise to standardize early across a platform or set of products. The problem is that the chosen language and its particulars often dominate and even limit a company’s ability to scale and build for the future. If your API is the most important thing, what does that say about all the people developing it and/or consuming it?</p>
