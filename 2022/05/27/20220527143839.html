<p>Life is hard and then you die. You can, however, enjoy the process of living; don’t worry about the fact that you’re going to die. Some bad people have a good life, and some good people have a bad life, and that doesn’t seem fair; but don’t worry about that either. Just think about ways of enjoying the journey.</p>
