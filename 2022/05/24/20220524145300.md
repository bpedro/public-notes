This is a test note to see if the GitHub action is working properly. If so, the following should happen:

- A link to https://github.com/bpedro/public-notes/blob/main/tags.md should be added under `#test`
- A link to this file should be added to https://github.com/bpedro/public-notes/blob/main/README.md
- This note should be converted to HTML and PDF
- The whole public notes website should be rebuilt and republished

**NOTE**: this edit should re-trigger the content processing.
